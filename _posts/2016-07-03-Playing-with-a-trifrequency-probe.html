<ul>
<li>Won the probe http://www.ebay.com/itm/Philips-ATL-Access-A-3Mhz-Ultrasound-Scanhead-Transducer-Probe-/262496926313?hash=item3d1e093a69:g:psAAAOSwcL5XMe0n (50$) -- that's a purely 3MHz probe, should be OK and we won't get too many issues with too high frequencies</li>
<li>Played with the ATL10PV at <a href="https://github.com/kelu124/murgen-dev-kit/blob/master/worklog/Session_9_ATL.md">https://github.com/kelu124/murgen-dev-kit/blob/master/worklog/Session_9_ATL.md</a>. Not good results, high frequency elements are buggy.</li>
<li>Any impact of the polarity of the pulse?? </li>
<li>TODO: Compare the polarity by switching polarity.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>With the help of Igor, preparing a UDP server of EMW3165 and getting a throughput of 9Mbit/s on average.</li>
<li>Getting one of the modules</li>
<li>Requesting Nicolas' help on getting HV7360LA (fab's suppliers are lost)</li>
<li>Thinking of the overall structure of the maker kit. I need a wooden box and an aquarium (plexiglass, glue = solvent cement)</li>
<li>Review of the HAD budget (probe, transducer, fab, et al?). Some euros may be saved.</li>
</ul>

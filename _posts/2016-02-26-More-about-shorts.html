<ul>
<li>Further tests. Shortage still exists.</li>
<li>Short is not on the PCB. Appears after solder.</li>
<li>Found that the RECOM component was designed to be upside down --
    need to resolder it. Luckily it was a via component.</li>
<li>This would not be the source of the short anyhow.</li>
<li>EF recommends that we burn 10A on the 5V plane to see which
 component would burn.. hmm i'm quite shy to do this :p</li>
<li>Documenting the issue on github.</li>
<li>Sending back boards to EF.</li>
</ul>

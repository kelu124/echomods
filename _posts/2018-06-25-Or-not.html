<li>Article: Impressive <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7982705/">Development of a Low-Cost Medical Ultrasound Scanner Using a Monostatic Synthetic Aperture</a></li>
<li>I'm a noob at this, but it seems that MFFS uses fixed focus piezos, but MSAS does focusing in the software (hence synthetic aperture) using a piezo of known size. That's an interesting alternative to focused piezos.</li>
<li>Some other interesting insights, like using "Quality Assurance for UltraSound (QA4US) software" for image quality assessment, or also the architecture they used (an ARM, 14-bit ADC at 12Msps), or even the fact that the piezo is in direct contact with the skin, or a motor using a Voice Coil Motor.</li>
<li>@done add the MSAS principles to the un0rick article</li>

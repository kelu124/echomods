 these have been assigned for 12bitADC+Clock and the rest,</li>
<li>SPI for DAC,</li>
<li>Buffer enable and motor control have been assigned to PRU0.</li>
<li>For the controls in prototyping:</li>
<li>SW1 controls the gain range for TGC</li>
<li>SW2 controls the input range of the ADC,</li>
<li>Updating the blog as well, integration of disqus</li>

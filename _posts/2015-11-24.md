-   TLDR
-   CapTech Workshop. Was great!
-   Acted upon a split between a FPGA long-term approach, and a non-FPGA
    one. I remembered those good old times when this was a possibility.
-   Damn it. What if I could dig into this? Not µC, rather an extension
    for an existing computer.. or mini computer.
-   Saw some ideas on the Arduino's side. Separate ADC.

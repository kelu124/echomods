<p>Got some <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14869138">amazing responses to the post on HN</a>, held the 1st pos for an hour +, got over 200 ups, that's quite enough =) I guess I'm coming close to an end on this project, and my target would be to try and have a presentable project before Year 2.  The five key milestones:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Outreach</strong>: I have sold 10 kits so far, have ordered 5 sets more to a CN PCBA. Will sell those - and let people choose what they want when they'll want to play with those. I guess I'll have the community Milestone reached when someone provide a significant improvement / publishes thanks to this kit. <em>Status: 50%</em>. Bonus point if a unreached continent so far is involved.</li>
<li>ENDOFYEAR: 15 kits sold, CN not good, MF ongoing (20171217)</li>
<li><strong>Money</strong>: thanks to the small margin on kits, and hackaday prizes, i'm quite <a href="/include/Finance.md">cash neutral</a> as of today. Having the 5 kits sold would permit financing the acquisition of the unmantled CN probe. <em>Status: 100%</em> Bonus:  trade the chinese probe on leboncoin / ebay.  <em>Status: 0%</em></li>
<li>ENDOFYEAR: still waiting (20171217)</li>
<li><strong>Product</strong>: I wanted to have a <strong>ultrasound hat</strong> done. I now have this ADC pHAT done, which can be perfected, but it's quite a win, so a simple 80V monopolar ultrasound board (independant from the motor / multiplexer) could be reached by Nov. <em>Status: 0%</em> Update: could be good to use the <a href="/retired/loftus/">probe head</a> to do a full portable probe =)</li>
<li>ENDOFYEAR: Ongoing with Matty (20171217)</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: There are a couple of notes here, I'd love to see all of those gathered / processed / put into a braindump. Gitbook is good enough, but lack structure for raw knowledge dump. TODOS include:</li>
<li>Listing all docs under YYYYMMDD</li>
<li>ENDOFYEAR: Quite happy, having added experiments (20171217)</li>
<li><strong>Future</strong> I'd be keen on having a 8 to 16 elements module prepared, just so to prepare the next gen and passing over of the project. Jan and Ivan to support. <em>Status: 0%</em> Muxing using ATTINY85 ?</li>
<li>ENDOFYEAR: Shifting to chaotic masks ;) (20171217)</li>
</ol>
<p>Nice to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A slack bot? It would be fun to have a supporting bot to answer queries, like "where are the elements benchmarked, how do you process dicom, ..."</li>
</ul>

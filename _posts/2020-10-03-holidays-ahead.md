A week of documentation ahead =)

-   With the help of @Jorge Arija, happy to release two small boards for
    HV !
-   https://github.com/kelu124/lm3478 for a LM3478 fixed output at +-90V
    (changeable between 80 and 200V by changing a feedback board),
    single 5V input.
-   https://github.com/kelu124/DRV8662-devkit for a small unipolar
    output of 250V with minimal BOM cost from 5V.
-   Need to update un0rick.cc website with Jekyll pages and tutos for
    the different products.
-   @todo mapping registers of the lit3rick device

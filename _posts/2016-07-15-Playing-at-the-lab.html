<p>Cleaning a signal with <a href="/goblin/">Goblin</a> : done. The second log, with this time a new energy supply, gives a really beautiful outcome. Lesson: don't put 18V in a 3.3 and 5V regulator =) <a href="https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/blob/master/goblin/2016-07-15.md">See the results here</a>.</p>

<p>Playign with an ATL Access 3. Getting nice echoes... of 1.3V, even not using the full gain (60%) and the full pulser voltage on <a href="https://github.com/kelu124/murgen-dev-kit">Murgen</a>. <a href="https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/tree/master/retired/retroATL3">See the logs here</a>.

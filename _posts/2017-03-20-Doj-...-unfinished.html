<li>Indeed. Forgot to add a ADC input directly from a strip, two strips for PulseOn and PulseOff, and a way to control the servo from the Pi.</li>
<li>Also starting the new season of the HackadayPrize =) </li>
<li>Still some issues with <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/20455-20msps-adc-raspberrypi-extension-bomanz">bomanz (on HAD)</a> PCB. Some pads suck. I guess I'll order the board from OSHPark along with <a href="/doj/">Doj's</a> and solder all these tiny stuff. Not so many actually.</li>

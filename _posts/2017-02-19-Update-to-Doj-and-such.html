<ul>
<li>Thinking about an update for a neat, silkcreened, well designed motherboard. Would be excellent for Altay, Felix and maybe </li>
<li>Been doing some progress about the HV - working with Lorena to get one on board. I'll have 2 pulsers, will ask for 3. In total I'll still be able to send to (Afreen/Felix/Altay) + one for the GroupGet friends. Would leave me with one. </li>
<li>Afreen still working on the feather, after contacting the PRUDAQ guys.</li>
<li>Get Felix on Slack?</li>
<li>Call scheduled with Fouad on tuesday</li>
<li>Making progress on 20e214 - control of the probe OK. Display remaining, then CSV saving.</li>
<li>Taking more time about the Slack bot: lower priority</li>
<li>Update by Tobey: he found a way to compare PDFs.</li>
</ul>

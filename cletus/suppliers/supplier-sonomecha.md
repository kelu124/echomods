### Notes
 
#### Echange in 2015

1. Which type do you want either higher amplitude oriented design transducer or wider bandwidth designed transducer?
2. Regarding Q1, if you can try to test both, it will better for more option.
3. Regarding transducer types, they are focused UT and unfocused UT. For the focused UT, the design of lens would not allowed to the lower costs. It means that the radius of curvature is 286mm,so the lens diameter is also so huge that the special design is required to match the tool. 
The actual diameter of element is 17mm,best but too much cost to make it.
4. Regarding unfocused UT, they are round type and rectangular type of piezo element. For round type, the actual diameter of piezo is 14.5mm and for rectangular type is 10x20mm based on our estimation of design. Both are matched to the focal point at 125mm.
5. For round type, we are doing experiment to match the diameter today. Due to the dia. around 15mm, the element
should be make the criteria by the mold size and sintering process of ceramics.  
6. For rectangular type, it is O.K. to meet your criteria.
7. The delivery would be max. 3 weeks, but will meet your two weeks.
8. The pricing is $300 for one UT, but 2 UTs are $500. In addition, the wire transfer fee is $25 and shipping fee(?).
    We need your shipping address to make a quote. (The shipping fee will calculates only if we know your address)

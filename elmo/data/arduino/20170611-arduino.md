## Experimenting with the [AD9200](/elmo/)

### Experiment

#### Setup

![](/elmo/data/arduino/setup.png)

Along with an arduino to drive the servo -- see [arduino code](/elmo/data/arduino/arduino.ino)

#### Code

* The [module code](/elmo/data/scope.c) to manage the ADC and operate the pHAT through a device
* The [shell script](/elmo/data/run.sh) to install the module
* The [interface code](/elmo/data/read.cpp) to store the data returned by the ADC in a file
* Raspberry-side [Python Code](/elmo/data/arduino.py) to manage the pulser, and create the different files
* [Arduino Code](/elmo/data/arduino.ino) for the arduino controlling the servomotor. Each pulse is counted by the arduino, which manages the servo.

#### The python notebook

See the [Jupyter Notebook](/elmo/data/arduino/20170611-arduino.ipynb) for an experiment acquiring the enveloppe of the signal.

#### Another one for the raw signals

* An this notebook for the [raw ultrasound data](/elmo/data/arduino/20170612-ArduinoFFTed.ipynb).

#### Raspberry

* I changed back the [kernel module](/elmo/data/arduino/scope.c) to have proper pulser pins
* The _readout_ program to get the ADC values has [been changed too](/elmo/data/arduino/read.cpp).

### Results

### Lessons

* The Raspberry Pi seems to have some issues driving "cleanly" the servo. A proper driver to manage the servo (in this case an arduino) may be necessary.
* I had some issues in soldering the [2nd ADC "cleanly" too](/elmo/data/20170609-NewADC-v3.ipynb), two pins were soldered one with the other. 
* May need to rework the biais though.
* The interleaved mode works and values for the latch work. So I know the 2x10Msps is not impossible! 

### Biais issue

* When the input signal is not put, ADC give a mid range signal (262 here out of 512)

* When the signal jumper is on, the ADCs yield the same figures, centered around 50, see below:

# apogee
* code:apogee
* smalldesc:apogee probe
* longdesc:An interspec apogee probe. Quite a number of pins, nice steel block for the motor and piezo. Connectors clean.

# adrus
* code:adrus
* smalldesc:a 5.5MHz ADR ultrasound probe
* longdesc:That's a 5.5MHz ADR ultrasound probe. Strange connector on the back, simple, shows there's a single connector. Mechanical coupling, rotation to sweeping, pair of cables to motor, pairs to the piezo.

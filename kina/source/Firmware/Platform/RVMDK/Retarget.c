	 1) Is this safe?  Will it catch all the zero bytes?
	 Suppose there is a byte with all zeros.  Any carry bits
	 propagating from its left will fall into the hole at its
	 least significant bit and stop.  Since there will be no
	 carry from its most significant bit, the LSB of the
	 byte to the left will be unchanged, and the zero will be
	 detected.

	 2) Is this worthwhile?  Will it ignore everything except
	 zero bytes?  Suppose every byte of LONGWORD has a bit set
	 somewhere.  There will be a carry into bit 8.  If bit 8
	 is set, this will carry into bit 16.  If bit 8 is clear,
	 one of bits 9-15 must be set, so there will be a carry
	 into bit 16.  Similarly, there will be a carry into bit
	 24.  If one of bits 24-30 is set, there will be a carry
	 into bit 31, so all of the hole bits will be changed.

	 The one misfire occurs when bits 24-30 are clear and bit
	 31 is set; in this case, the hole at bit 31 is not
	 changed.  If we had access to the processor carry flag,
	 we could close this loophole by putting the fourth hole
	 at bit 32!

	 So it ignores everything except 128's, when they're aligned
	 properly.

	 3) But wait!  Aren't we looking for C as well as zero?
	 Good point.  So what we do is XOR LONGWORD with a longword,
	 each of whose bytes is C.  This turns each byte that is C
	 into a zero.  */

     bytes in the longword in question are equal to c.  We first use an xor
     with repeated_c.  This reduces the task to testing whether *any of the
     four* bytes in longword1 is zero.

     We compute tmp =
       ((longword1 - repeated_one) & ~longword1) & (repeated_one << 7).
     That is, we perform the following operations:
       1. Subtract repeated_one.
       2. & ~longword1.
       3. & a mask consisting of 0x80 in every byte.
     Consider what happens in each byte:
       - If a byte of longword1 is zero, step 1 and 2 transform it into 0xff,
	 and step 3 transforms it into 0x80.  A carry can also be propagated
	 to more significant bytes.
       - If a byte of longword1 is nonzero, let its lowest 1 bit be at
	 position k (0 <= k <= 7); so the lowest k bits are 0.  After step 1,
	 the byte ends in a single bit of value 0 and k bits of value 1.
	 After step 2, the result is just k bits of value 1: 2^k - 1.  After
	 step 3, the result is 0.  And no carry is produced.
     So, if longword1 has only non-zero bytes, tmp is zero.
     Whereas if longword1 has a zero byte, call j the position of the least
     significant zero byte.  Then the result has a zero at positions 0, ...,
     j-1 and a 0x80 at position j.  We cannot predict the result at the more
     significant bytes (positions j+1..3), but it does not matter since we
     already have a non-zero bit at position 8*j+7.

     So, the test whether any byte in longword1 is zero is equivalent to
     testing whether tmp is nonzero.  */

# What is this project? [](@description Pitch/Intro of the project)

This project has a specific target of providing a __low-cost, open source technological kit to allow scientists, academics, hackers, makers or OSHW fans to hack their way to ultrasound imaging__ - below 500$ - at home, with no specific equipment required. For complementary sources of information, you can visit:

* the [github repo](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/), for the source files, raw data and raw experiment logs;
* the [online manual/book](https://www.gitbook.com/book/kelu124/echomods/details) for a easily readable and searchable archive of the whole work;
  * with [list of probes](/include/probes/)
  * and [list of experiments](/include/experiments/)
* the [hackaday page](https://hackaday.io/project/9281-murgen-open-source-ultrasound-imaging), where I tried to blog day-to-day experiments in a casual format;
* an [article summarizing the experiment on the Journal of Open Hardware](http://openhardware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/joh.2/) - [DOI:10.5334/joh.2]( http://doi.org/10.5334/joh.2);
* the [slack channel if you want to discuss](https://join.slack.com/usdevkit/shared_invite/MTkxODU5MjU0NjI1LTE0OTY1ODgxMDEtMmYyZTliZDBlZA);
* the Tindie store for the [analog processing unit](https://www.tindie.com/products/kelu124/ultrasound-imaging-analog-processing-module/) and the [unipolar pulser](https://www.tindie.com/products/kelu124/ultrasound-unipolar-high-voltage-pulser/) or [the motherboard](https://www.tindie.com/products/kelu124/ultrasound-modules-motherboard/).
* And of course, the [ice40 research board](https://www.tindie.com/products/kelu124/un0rick-open-ice40-ultrasound-imaging-dev-board/), on [un0rick.cc](http://un0rick.cc) and its [doc](http://doc.un0rick.cc) or even [its github](https://github.com/kelu124/un0rick). _It's a bit cheaper, and has better specs_.

* __Disclaimer #0__: __This is not a medical ultrasound scanner__! It's a development kit that can be used for pedagogical and academic purposes - possible immediate use as a non-destructive testing (NDT) tool, for example in metallurgical crack analysis. As in all electronics, be [careful](/WordOfCaution.md).
* __Disclaimer #1__: though an engineer, this project is the first of its sort, I never did something related. It's all but a finalized product.
* __Disclaimer #2__: Ultrasound raises questions. In case you build a scanner, use caution and good sense!
* __Disclaimer #3__: This project is not part of echopen.



## What are the arduino-like ultrasound module ?

__Creating modules to facilitate ultrasound hacking__ : the principles of the echOmods is to enable a full chain of ultrasound image processing and hardware control.

We have chosen to use a module approach to make sure that each key component inside ultrasound image processing can easily be replaced and compared with another module, while providing logical _logic blocks_ and corresponding interfaces for these modules to communicate. There's a module for [high-voltage pulsing](/retired/tobo/), one for the [transducer](/retroATL3/), one for the [analog processing](/goblin/), one for [data acquisiton](/retired/toadkiller/), ... and many more!

## What images does it give ?

## What does it look like?

The modules sit on a breadboard, and communicate through the tracks laying below. The configuration represented below show the Basic dev kit.

## Ultrasound hardware structure

[](@description Short description of the organization of modules)

To produce an image, the modules have to create a [high voltage pulse](/retired/tobo/), which excites a [transducer](/retroATL3/). Echoes coming from the body are amplified using a [TGC + LNA](/goblin/), which cleans the analog signal, which itself [gets digitalized](/retired/toadkiller/). 

The diagram is represented below:
